Description: # nba_stats
        Contains functions used to import and manipulate a database of weather statistics.
        
        The weather data used is GHCN-daily.
        
        Note that the GHCN-Daily dataset itself now has a DOI (Digital Object Identifier)
        so it may be relevant to cite both the methods/overview journal article as well 
        as the specific version of the dataset used.
        
        The journal article describing GHCN-Daily is:
        Menne, M.J., I. Durre, R.S. Vose, B.E. Gleason, and T.G. Houston, 2012:  An overview 
        of the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily Database.  Journal of Atmospheric 
        and Oceanic Technology, 29, 897-910, doi:10.1175/JTECH-D-11-00103.1.
        
        To acknowledge the specific version of the dataset used, please cite:

        Daily (GHCN-Daily), Version 3. [indicate subset used following decimal, 
        e.g. Version 3.12].

        The path of the directory where the data was downloaded to must be set.
        To do this use function set_path function. (To import use "from weather.functions.config import set_path").
        This function requires only the desired path as input.
        Only needs to be set once, will be maintained on new sessions.
